I worked on a project to structure and analyze job descriptions for the City of Los Angeles. Using Python, I conducted text analysis on a large set of plain-text job postings to identify areas for improvement in the content, tone, and format of job bulletins. I then created a structured CSV file from the plain-text job postings and analyzed the structured data to identify job descriptions and answer questions. Based on these insights, I developed recommendations to improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool and help people find jobs in the city.
